Denoising is a pre-processing step in the digital image processing system. It is also a typical image processing challenge. Many works proposed to solve problems with new approaches. They can be divided into two main categories: spatial-based or transform-based. Some denoising methods apply in both spatial and transform domains. 

The goal of this paper focuses on reviewing denoise methods, classifying them into different categories, and identifying new trends. Moreover, we do experiments to compare the pros, cons of methods in surveys.
